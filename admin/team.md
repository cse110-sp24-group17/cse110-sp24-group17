### Ryan L.

Hello! I'm Ryan, a second year Computer Science major here at UC San Diego in Revelle College. A few things I enjoy spending my free time doing:

1. **Hanging out with friends**
   - Here's a [goofy picture](https://ryanliulwy.github.io/CSE110-Lab1/images/hatstack.png) they took of me and a mighty stack of hats a while back
2. **Playing video games**
   - Recently I've been getting into a game called _The Finals_
   - I've also been playing a lot of modded _Terraria_ these days
   - Unfortunately, my friends also drag me into their _League of Legends_ matches
3. **Practicing the piano**
   - I used to take part in piano competitions before ([here's a recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncm4KW2-Qyw) of one of the hardest pieces I learned!)
   - Now I mostly do it for fun and play music from shows and games I like :)

### Sunho

My name is Sunho. I’m a third year cs student from Muir College.

I’ve been really passionate about programming since when I was in elementary school. So, if you want to have a nerdy technical discussion or are stuck on some weird bug, feel free to hit me up! If you’re curious about the works I’ve done, you can find them in: [suhno.io](https://sunho.io)

Besides work, I love playing chess and tetris. I’ve also started cooking most of my meal since last year and it has become a sort of hobby. The best food I can make is spicy stir-fried fork. I try to jog every single day, so you might find me running across campus at random hours.
