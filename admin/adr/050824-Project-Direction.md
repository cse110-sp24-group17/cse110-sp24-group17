# Project Goals 5/8/24

## Context
Finalization of decisions made following the brainstorming process from [5/3/24](https://github.com/cse110-sp24-group17/cse110-sp24-group17/blob/main/specs/brainstorm/first_miro_board.md),
where proposed ideas were considered and then either accepted, rejected, or tabled for later. Purpose of decisions are to set clear goals for project outcomes and general guidelines for development.

## Decisions
1. **Main features to develop as first priority: Daily Journal, Project Notes, Calendar, Task List**
These features are fundamental aspects that complement each other and would work to build up a comprehensive work journal experience. These features adhere to the
given philosophies of local-first, protocol-based, and minimalism. These features will be tabularly presented, where users will default to the journal display, and may choose to
navigate to the other features in clearly communicated ways. They also have the option to ignore the rest of the features if they so choose.
This motivates simplicity and avoids flooding users with unnecessary displays.

3. **Secondary features to plan for, but develop later on: Online synchronization**
These features are helpful or would be nice to have, and could help set our product apart. However, these either require a fully functional base application
before implementation is possible, or otherwise pose a more difficult learning curve and consuming timeline in order to produce.

4. **Features intentionally discluded: Online collaboration, any other features not listed**
Further features than what is already listed in the previous two categories would pose too large of a challenge to properly implement in the given time-frame,
or otherwise conflict with the minimalist philosophy of this project

5. **Code Development and Architecture**
To address the team's varying skill levels and the projects short timeframe, the core HTML/CSS/Javascript trio will be the chosen framework. Databases may be
proposed and considered at a later time, if the project is able to advance to that stage. To increase team and individual productivity, a modular approach will
be taken in order to facilitate simultaneous work on multiple tasks by sub-teams.
