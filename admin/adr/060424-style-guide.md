## File Naming Style
Chosen style: For code-related files and folders, use snake_case. For non-code-related files and folders, use kebab-case. This can help maintain repository clarity by distinguishing code assets from non-code documents.
Consistent naming rules in general can contribute to repo organization and cleanliness.

General rules: To improve readability, keep file and folder names relatively short but still relevant to their purposes.
