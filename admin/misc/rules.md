## Contract

### Expectations of Communication
The team Slack channel will be the primary method of communication for this course. If necessary, correspondence may also be sent through team members' UCSD emails.
Team members are expected to respond to communication on the team Slack channel within 48 hours. They are expected to communicate any conflicts, inability to fulful responsbilities, or general questions/comments/concerns as they arise.

### Team Meetings
Team meetings will happen weekly on Wednesdays from 3:00 to 5:00 PM at the CSE Basement. Team members are expected to attend these meetings every week, though reasonable flexibility may be afforded for members to arrive late or leave early.
If a member must miss one of these weekly meetings, they must clearly communicate their absence ahead of time, as well as the reason for their absence.
Additional meetings may be scheduled as necessary, either in-person or online. Team members are encouraged to attend such meetings when possible, but it is not a requirement.

### General Responsibilities for all Members
In addition to the expectations of communication and attendance as described above, all team members are expected to fulfill the following general responsibilities:
1. If a task is delegated to a team member, and they agree to take on that task, they are expected to complete that task to their fullest ability and in a timely manner. If they are aware that they are unable to effectively complete the task, they should communicate so that the task may be re-assigned or re-evaluated.
3. Meeting minute note-taker: The responsibility of taking minutes at meetings will rotate weekly. No one person should be the one taking notes all the time.
4. Further responsibilities to be updated as necessary.

### Specific Roles
__To be updated once the project starts rolling.__

### Conflict Resolution
If the terms of this contract are violated by a team member, or other generally innappropriate behaviors arise, an individual meeting will first be scheduled with the Team Leads, Ryan L. and Sunho.
Failing to resolve the issue at this point, or in the case of a breakdown of communications, our TA Kashish will be contacted to further address the situation.
