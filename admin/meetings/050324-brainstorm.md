## Meeting Summary

Discussion topics

- Platform/Medium Chrome extension? - Would be nice, but should not be the only container for the app - Pop-up for a minimalized version of full app?
  Syncing features?
- Website/app or desktop app (electron?)
  - Personalized vs Collaboration
    - Collaboration-based is very rabbit-hole-y -- very difficult to do in short amount of time
  - Would be very cool, but probably too ambitious
- Online vs Offline
  - Prioritize offline-based functionality first
  - Ability to sync between devices can be a goal, but a very end-stage one
    - Potential workaround: export contents of work log in a local format that can be directly uploaded?
- Work Journal vs Task List vs Calendar

  - Focus on Work Journal:
    - each journal sort by label/alphabetical order

To-do-list for next assignment:

- Write the pitch

1. Problem — The raw idea, a use case, or something we’ve seen that motivates us to work on this
2. Appetite — How much time we want to spend and how that constrains the solution
3. Solution — The core elements we came up with, presented in a form that’s easy for people to immediately understand
4. Rabbit holes — Details about the solution worth calling out to avoid problems
5. No-gos — Anything specifically excluded from the concept: functionality or use cases we intentionally aren’t covering to fit the appetite or make the problem tractable
